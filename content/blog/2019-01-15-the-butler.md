First step is to set up a Git hub account at <https://github.com> as this will be used for your Netlify account as well.

Net up go to [netlify.com](netlify.com) and link your git account to Netlify in the signup.

Here are where your sites are going to be. First off we're going to say you want a template for your website (as it's much easier to use) so lets start with that!

Head over to <https://templates.netlify.com/tags/jekyll/> and pick a nice template. I'm going to stick with this once since it's straight forward. Then click on Deploy site

Now were on this this page, you can just move forward as you have a github already. This will create a repository.

You can now rename the repository (this name will show up in your github main page, so name it well) once you have it named go ahead and deploy your site!

Your site is now deploying so sit back and wait, this could take a bit depending on connections.

You now have a base website! congratulations! but were not done yet, almost there. Go ahead and type **/admin** at the end of the URL to start editing your pages based on what you would like!

But lets hold on, lets say you made your own website because you're just that cool...so how do you add it to Netlify? Lets take a look...

Now first go ahead and install Github Desktop: a handy tool for uploading files straight to Github. Then once it's open and linked to your github just grab the file, drag it to the open window, and drop it. Yep, just that easy. There will be a popup that asks you to creat a repository, just go set it up with a name and make it public.

Ok and we're back to this set up as you return to your home in Netlify. Once the file is on github you can simply click on New site from Git and we move forward!

Got to the github button to select an item from your repository.

![](/images/set5.png)

Now select the repository you want to use(i have alot of junk in there so don't let it confuse you)

![](/images/set6.png)

Ensure Branch to Deploy is set to **master** and then simply deploy site. If your HTML is proper than it should not have any issues in the next stage

![](/images/set7.png)

Now sit back and wait for that site to be deployed!

And there we go! your own site is now being hosted by netlify! I hope this helps you create something even better than i showed you. Happy programming
